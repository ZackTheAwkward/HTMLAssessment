#HTMLAssessment

### Description
The object of this project was to create a HTML webpage that implemented some of the basic HTML elements in proper formatting. The page would display 3 text blocks with generic text using bolded words and an italicized text block. A table to show the score from a sporting event, using different rows to show the score during different quarters, as well as a total score. A list to show an image for each team, a hyperlink to allow the viewer to go to the teams webpage, and a list of the teams head coach and athletes listed in order by position. A form for users to input their first and last name, their favorite sport, a check box for how they have experienced the sport, their preferred level of experience for the sport, and a submit button.

### Lessons Learned
This was a really fun project that helped better understand the basic elements of an HTML webpage. For the most part the formatting was easy to understand, however I did have issues with the form section of the project. In the end it was as simple as closing out one of my tags in order for the checked box section to display properly. HTML will render regardless of any errors present in the code. So catching errors at times was a little more difficult since Atom saw that the code would render and not throw any error messages.
